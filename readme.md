## MEMES AND GIFS PROJECT

This project is originated from an idea of developing a memes and gifs web application like Giphy. Anyone can access to this application and views the content, but only users who are registered can upload their own gifs/memes. Besides viewing and obtaining links of the multimedia resources, users can also search for these items according to their references.

The project is developed with React for client-side and Laravel for server-side.

## Installation

### Client Side:

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm run start
```

### Server Side :

#### Migrate table to database:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

#### Run server

```bash
  php artisan serve
```
